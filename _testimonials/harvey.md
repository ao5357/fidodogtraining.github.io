When we adopted Harvey, we knew at 8 months old he needed some serious obedience 
training. We had no idea that we would also be confronted with some very tough 
behavioral issues, and Tammy and Sarah were there for us every step of the way. 
When you come to Fido, expect to work hard, expect to get a big adjustment to 
the way you look at your relationship with your dog, and expect to learn as 
much as (often times more than) your dog does! We could not have offered Harvey 
the quality of life he enjoyed without Fido's help, and we are better dog owners 
today because of it. Wherever your needs fit on the spectrum, Tammy and Sarah 
can help. We have taken advantage of private sessions, most of their class 
offerings, and their Happy Dog Walking Service and will always highly recommend 
anything offered there. Their small class size also means you will get lots of 
one-on-one time with them, a feature many positive reinforcement programs in 
the area cannot offer. For the person who is serious about being a responsible 
dog owner AND who wants to maximize their relationship with their dog, there is 
no better place to be.

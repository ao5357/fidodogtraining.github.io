I used to work for a small local animal shelter. Tammy and Sarah from Fido 
volunteered their time on a weekly basis to work with our dogs training, 
socializing and teaching them manners. Ultimately this made our dogs more 
adoptable and we were able to place several previously hard-to-place dogs into 
great homes. They made a huge difference in the experience our dogs had at the 
shelter and ultimately their ability to be adopted. I would recommend Fido to 
anyone - whether it is for training, dog sitting or dog walking. They really 
understand dogs!

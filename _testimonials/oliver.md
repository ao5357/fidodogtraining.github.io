Dear FIDO,

I love my classes at Fido! Tammy and Sarah are so kind and patient, and
everybody has fun. Best of all, they've really helped my new family to
understand me. I'm a smart guy but I was having a hard time with that
housebreaking idea, and I thought pulling on the leash was cool.
Tammy and Sarah had lots of ideas and suggestions.
My people wised up, and then I understood right away what they wanted.
And then I got treats and hugs. Yay!

Oliver

tagline: "Take your dog to FIDO!"

We first started taking our dogs to classes at Fido in 2010 when we got a puppy. 
Since then, our puppy has grown into adulthood, and we've taken him through every 
Fido class from puppy class through Beginner classes, into Intermediate class 
and the Advanced class. We've also taken our older dog to Fido classes, to brush 
up on skills he learned years ago. I mention all of this to say that we've taken 
many classes with Fido and have a lot of experience with them. Over the years, 
we've also taken a bunch of obedience classes elsewhere, so I have a few points 
of comparison. I can't say enough good things about Fido. IT'S A GREAT PLACE. 
Why do I rave about them to every dog owner that I meet?

  * Very small classes (4-5 dogs with TWO instructors) means a lot of personal attention
  * Many opportunities to get individualized help with your dog's particular challenges
  * A positive training approach that follows the most current research on animal learning and human-dog bonds

Tammy and Sarah are VERY experienced instructors (unlike the kids teaching 
classes at chain pet stores, who have had at most a two-week intro to dog 
training). They love dogs. They're incredibly skilled at the most important part 
of having a well-behaved dog: teaching dog owners to effectively communicate 
with the dog. This is crucial! Tammy and Sarah are teaching you to teach your 
dog so much more than a SIT or a DOWN - they teach you how to teach your dog 
what you need him to know, in ways that make sense to the dog. Did I mention 
that they're kind, fun, funny, cool people?

Tammy and Sarah are available by phone and email for questions and problem 
solving, even after the class is over. Fido has cool workshops and seminars on 
topics like dog first aid, reading dog body language, etc. Classes are a lot of 
fun. We look forward to them and the dogs look forward to them.

They have a funky studio in funky Ferndale.

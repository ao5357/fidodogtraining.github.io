:dog: The page you were looking for does not appear to exist. Maybe you were looking 
for one of these instead:

{% assign pages = site.autopages %}
<ul>
  <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
  {% for p in pages %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ p.url }}">
      {{ p.title }}
    </a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

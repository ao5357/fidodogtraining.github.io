Tammy has loved dogs her whole life. She started a pet sitting/dog walking business, "Happy Dog 
Walking Service" in 1997. She still has this business today.

Tammy's goal in life is to help dogs live long, happy lives with their human guardians. She wants 
to teach people how to communicate with their pets in a dog-friendly way, so that their dogs can 
truly understand what is being asked of them.

Tammy teaches only Positive Reinforcement Training (PRT), which she believes is the most rewarding 
and compassionate way to train a dog. This method helps both dog and owner to communicate better, 
whille having fun at the same time.

Tammy was educated in Positive Reinforcement Training at Animal Behavior College; graduating with 
honors, and was certified as a trainer in 2006. She has also earned her certification 
through the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers. Tammy now joins nearly 2,000 
CPDT-KA Certified trainers worldwide.

Tammy is currently giving private and group obedience classes through her company "FIDO Personal Dog 
Training, LLC".

Tammy lives in the wilds of Oak Park, Michigan with her husband Robert, their two lovable rescued 
pit bull mixes, Lilly and Daisy, a very precocious Amazon parrot Petey, and Posey her action-packed 
cat.

In July of 2008 I adopted my best buddy, a then-4-year-old Tibetan Terrier. Sprocket was close to perfect 
from the start; cute, cuddly, enthusiastic about giving kisses and taking walks. He did have one small 
problem, though: he was a cat chaser!

With three felines in the house, dog-chases-cat was more than a minor issue. Calling on the services of 
a professional, I had Tammy out to the house to see if my animals could live in harmony.

From the first 'click' of Tammy's clicker, Sprocket and I were hooked on Positive Reinforcement training. 
Seeing his eyes light up as he realized that he could make good things happen by obeying cues was amazing. 
Turning the clicker over to me, Tammy showed me how to teach Sprocket some basic cues. Watching me work 
with him, she remarked that I had good instincts and that I should consider becoming a dog trainer!

I took her words to heart. I've always been an animal lover, and making a career out of working with dogs 
sounded right up my alley! Now I'm an Animal Behavior College Certified Dog Trainer, and I know I've found 
my passion.

I love getting people to that "lightbulb" moment with their dogs: where dog and person learn to communicate 
with each other, maybe for the first time ever. Training our dogs is so satisfying; it deepens our bond and 
really helps us to know our pup. __And it's fun!__ Positive Reinforcement training motivates our dogs to work 
with us, so that training feels like play instead of work.

Sprocket has two sisters now: an English Lab named Molly Moo Cow, and an odd little poodle/muppet mix 
named Tchotchke. The three of them keep me on my toes and provide plenty of opportunity to train every day.

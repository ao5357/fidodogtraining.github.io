## Tammy Crenshaw

### Owner, Head Trainer

<img class="right" src="/images/tammy.jpg" alt="" />

I have lived with and loved dogs my whole life and have worked with them for 17 years. 
I started a pet sitting/dog walking business in 1997 and have been training since 2005. 
I live in Oak Park, Michigan with my husband Robert, our pit bull mix Daisy, the action-packed 
cat Posey, and a 30 year old Amazon Parrot named Petey.

One of my primary personal and professional goals is to help dogs live happy lives with their 
human guardians. By teaching people how to communicate with their pets in a way that both 
human and dog can truly understand, I hope to do my part in making dog and human worlds a 
better place.

In my training, I use only science based, force free methods. My first-hand experience has 
shown me that this is the most rewarding, compassionate, and effective way to train a dog. 
I believe positive reinforcement methods are much less stressful on dogs than 
punishment based methods. In fact, most dogs look forward to and even enjoy clicker 
training sessions!

I graduated from Animal Behavioral College with honors in 2006. I continued my studies 
by earning my certification through the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers 
as a Certified Professional Dog Trainer – Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) in 2011. I offer 
private and group classes through my company Fido Personal Dog Training, LLC in Ferndale, Michigan.

## Sarah Maki

### Head Trainer, Groomer, Office Manager

<img class="right" src="/images/sarah.jpg" alt="" />
In July of 2008 I adopted my best buddy, a then-4-year-old Tibetan Terrier. Sprocket was close to perfect 
from the start; cute, cuddly, enthusiastic about giving kisses and taking walks. He did have one small 
problem, though: he was a cat chaser!

Calling on the services of a professional, I had Tammy out to the house to see if my animals could live in harmony.

From the first 'click' of the clicker, Sprocket and I were hooked on Positive Reinforcement Training. 
Seeing his eyes light up as he realized that he could make good things happen by obeying cues was amazing. 
I couldn't get enough of that reaction, so now I'm an Animal Behavior College Certified Dog Trainer, 
and my passion is my career.

I love getting people to that "lightbulb" moment with their dogs: where dog and person learn to communicate 
with each other, maybe for the first time ever. Training our dogs is so satisfying; it deepens our bond and 
really helps us to know our pup. __And it's fun!__ Positive Reinforcement training motivates our dogs to work 
with us, so that training feels like play instead of work.

After adopting my third dog (a silly little muppet mix named Tchotchke), I realized there was another thing I could 
do to help further the Postitive Reinforcement message; learn to groom in a way that respects the dog's boundaries. Trips 
to the groomer were always stressful. Sprocket and Tchothcke would have to be dragged into the tub and came home exhausted 
and clearly unhappy. I didn't like putting them through it, but their coats needed professional care. Even my English Lab,
Molly, hated going for baths, and she's a pretty easy-going gal. I became determined to find another way, and attended Bingo
Institute of Grooming to learn how to bathe, clip and scissor. 

Fido's Gray Dog Grooming opened its doors in Decemeber 2016 an I couldn't be prouder. My years of experience in canine body
language let me recognize when a dog needs coaching, a different method, or just a break. The team at Fido gave their input and 
we designed a salon that minimizes stress and truly is something special. We hope you'll check us out and know you'll see the 
difference between "assembly line" groomers and what we're doing here.

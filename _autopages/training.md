In addition to [classes](/classes), we offer multiple training options to suit your needs.

## Day Training

We start your dog's training for you! During our weekly sessions we teach cues and behaviors and then practice them in your home, our office, and other locations such as the park and your neighborhood. It helps your dog get professional training in weeks instead of months! 

## Private lessons at our office

Dog behaving badly? Need more personal attention than a group class allows? Schedule a one-on-one lesson at our office to address any behavioral or obedience problem you are having.

## Private lessons in your home

We will come to you! Private, in-home training is customized to solve any issue you need help with.

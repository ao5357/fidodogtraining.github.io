  1.
    ## No Choke or Prong collars
    A martingale or flat buckle collar or harness can be used in class. Martingale collars are 
    mandatory for all classes except puppy. No flexi leashes.
  2.
    ## Training Tools and Treats
    You will need a training tool called a “Clicker” and some very yummy food treats. We 
    recommend small mixed up pieces of hot dog, cheese, chicken or any tasty treat your dog 
    really likes. Soft treats work best for training. We sell a variety of wonderful soft 
    training treats as well as clickers.

    *_Please bring a long lasting treat for your dog to help them during class time while we are 
    teaching. We recommend a stuffed Kong, with something like peanut butter or wet dog food 
    to keep your pup busy for a few minutes. Try freezing it so it will last longer._
  3.
    ## Children in class
    Dog owners who want their child to be responsible for training must make sure their child 
    is capable of being consistent in training and is not physically over powered by the pup.
  4. 
    ## Vaccinations
    All dogs must be up to date on all vaccinations and fecal exams.

    *_See Customer Agreement Form for the list of vaccinations_
  5.
    ## Recommended
    Do not feed your dog right before class. If they are hungry they will pay closer attention 
    to you while training. Some exercise before class can help lower energy levels and stress 
    levels to help your dog stay better focused. Remember to wear comfortable clothing and flat 
    shoes to class.

    ## Punctuality

  8.
    ## Absences
    Training your dog is an important commitment and our program is designed so that each 
    class builds upon the previous session. Attending each class is very important. However, if 
    you are going to miss a class please let us know as far in advance as possible.

  1.
    ## No Choke or Prong collars
    A martingale or flat buckle collar can be used in puppy classes. Martingale collars are 
    mandatory for all other classes. If you need help fitting a martingale collar, we sell several brands and would be happy to help you choose one for your dog.  No flexi leashes.
  2.
    ## Training Tools and Treats
    You will need your clicker and some very yummy food treats. We 
    recommend small pieces of hot dog, cheese, chicken or any tasty treat your dog 
    really likes. Soft treats work best for training. We sell a variety of  
    training treats as well as clickers.

    *_Please bring a long lasting treat for your dog to help them during class time while we are 
    teaching. We recommend a Kong stuffed with something like peanut butter or wet dog food 
    to keep your pup busy. Try freezing it so it will last longer._
  3.
    ## Children in class
    Dog owners who want their child to be responsible for training must make sure their child 
    is capable of being consistent in training and is not physically over-powered by the dog.
  4. 
    ## Vaccinations
    Dogs must be up to date on all vaccinations and fecal exams.

    *_See Customer Agreement Form for the list of required vaccinations_
  5.
    ## Recommended
    Do not feed your dog right before class. If they are hungry they will pay closer attention 
    to you while training. Some exercise before class can help lower energy and stress 
    levels and help your dog stay focused. Remember to wear comfortable clothing and flat 
    shoes to class.

    ## Punctuality

  8.
    ## Absences
    Training your dog is an important commitment and our program is designed so that each 
    class builds upon the previous session. Attending each class is very important. However, if 
    you are going to miss a class please let us know as far in advance as possible.

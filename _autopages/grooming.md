Your dog deserves to look great without stress. As with our training programs, Fido's Gray Dog Grooming 
was designed with your dog’s safety and comfort in mind. 

Our brand-new facility features a stainless-steel tub lined with noise-canceling 
matting, and a host of other features to ensure your pup’s comfort.

Other groomers cut corners; we are uncompromising about quality. Here’s how we’re 
different:

  * Use food, praise, and a slow approach so your dog is never overwhelmed
  * Offer “no-groom” visits so dogs can get used to the space (and enjoy a treat!)
  * Reduce noise with cotton and a “Happy Hoodie” during drying
  * Strategically pre-trim heavy coats to speed drying time
  * Provide guidance, handouts, and videos to prepare for a visit
  * Drop your dog off at home free of charge (with the option for a walk too!)
  * Walk-in floor tub for dogs that are too large for normal grooming tubs

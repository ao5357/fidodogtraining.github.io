Your dog deserves to look great without stress. With our boutique Gray Dog Grooming 
service, like Fido training, your dog’s safety and comfort are our highest priority.

Our brand-new facility features a stainless-steel tub lined with noise-canceling 
matting, and a host of other features to ensure your pup’s comfort.

Other groomers cut corners; we are uncompromising about quality. Here’s how we’re 
different:

  * Use food, praise, and a slow approach so your dog is never overwhelmed
  * Offer “no-groom” visits so dogs can get used to the space (and enjoy a treat!)
  * Reduce noise with cotton and a “Happy Hoodie”
  * Strategically pre-trim heavy coats to speed drying time
  * Provide guidance, handouts, and videos to prepare for a visit
  * Drop your dog off at home free of charge (with the option for a walk too!)

Call now [(248) 854-5540] to schedule an appointment and get an estimate.

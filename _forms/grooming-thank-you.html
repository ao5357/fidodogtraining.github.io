<p>We appreciate you filling out the Grooming Customer Agreement, and are
excited to see you for your appointment</p>

<p>Please take a quick second to double-check the next steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Vet records</strong>: Have your Veterinarian fax at least the last
  11 months of records (if applicable) to (248) 398-8600, or email them to <a href="mailto:fidofetch@sbcglobal.net">fidofetch@sbcglobal.net</a></li>
  <li>If your dog is over 6 months, ensure they have received up-to-date Dhppl, Rabies, Bordetella, Fecal and Heartworm vaccinations</li>
  <li>If your dog is a puppy, ensure they've received two series of their puppy vaccinations</li>
  <li>If you have not already (and it applies), be sure to pay your $50 deposit</li>
  <li>Inform your emergency contact of their responsibility, if necessary</li>
  <li>Please review our <a href="/rules-for-class/">class rules</a></li>
  <li>Add the class to your calendar</li>
</ol>

<p>See you soon!</p>

So you just got a puppy — congrats! Our Puppy 1 class will give you and your new four-legged family member the skills needed to grow into a well-rounded, happy adult dog! 

We’ll teach you the basics of clicker training and help you tackle and understand common puppy problem behaviors like house breaking, chewing and mouthing, jumping up and more. Basic cues like, sit, down, stand and the beginnings of loose leash walking will be covered, along with some fun tricks and self-control exercises! 

Just as importantly, your puppy will learn about and experience other dogs, people and new environments — all important to your pup’s social development! Each class includes several short, carefully-controlled play sessions to help your puppy learn the acceptable rules of social interaction with other dogs. 

This class is for pups between the ages of 2 1/2 to 4 months old. Puppies between 5-6 months old are welcome to join our 
Puppy 2 class but are not eligible for Puppy 1. Puppies must have two rounds of vaccinations before attending class. 

_Please, come join the fun! Your puppy will love you for it_

## There is no time like now to start training your puppy

Puppies are cute, cuddly, sweet, and wonderful. _Until_ they use the living room 
as a toilet, the sofa as a chew toy, or your prized rose garden as a playground. 
Our puppy classes will help teach you what to do when these things happen.

In class, you will learn how to teach your pup to sit, stay, and come when 
called. We will work on problem behaviors like:

  * House breaking
  * Chewing and mouthing
  * Biting
  * Jumping up

Most important of all, your puppy will learn about other dogs, people, and new 
environments.

They will play in carefully-controlled play sessions with the other pups. This 
will help your puppy learn about the acceptable rules of social interaction 
with other dogs. Puppy socialization is a very important phase in your pup's 
social development.

_Please, come join the fun! Your puppy will love you for it_

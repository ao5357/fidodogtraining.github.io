Lay a good training foundation and start your dog off on the right paw with this six-week clicker course! 

Basic One is for dogs four months and older (little pups, see our Puppy 1 class!) who have not had previous formal
obedience training or who need to brush up on the basics. Class itinerary includes Watch, Hand Targeting and Drop It 
as well as teaching the dogs to come when called, working on solid Stays, and reinforcing attention even while 
distracted. 
 
Our small class sizes mean that we can tailor exercises to your dog’s skill level, so even if he already knows a thing or two Basic One is useful for fine tuning and making responses more reliable. If your dog sits “only when he wants to” or “just doesn’t listen”, this is the class for you!

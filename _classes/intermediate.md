We play lots of games geared towards improving your dog's self-control and 
teaching them that paying attention to you is a very rewarding thing!

For dogs that have completed Basic 2: more distraction work with "stay" and recall.

  * Control work - working on self-control when walking by people and other dogs
  * Going to their beds or kennels and laying down on command
  * Staying calm when your dog gets excited
  * Teaching your dog to have better focus on you
  * Solving behavioral problems
  * More tricks and fun

_Look forward to seeing the improvements!_

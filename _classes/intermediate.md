You’ve laid a solid training foundation, successfully added distance, duration and distraction, improved your own training skills… Now, let’s sharpen your understanding of how your dog communicates with you and the world! Dogs tell us a lot through body language, so the better we understand what they're saying, the better our relationship with them! 

We play lots of fun games geared towards further developing your dog’s self-control, helping you improve your timing and technique and teaching your dog to make good choices like focusing on you and staying calm. Each Intermediate class also tailors part of the syllabus to the behavioral needs of the individual dogs in the class!

_Look forward to seeing the improvements!_

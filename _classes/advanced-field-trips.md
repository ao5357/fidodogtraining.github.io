Our advanced field trip class takes you and your dog out and about to work 
on leash manners, reactivity, and recall.

We practice self-control and focus in everyday situations, and teach you to 
keep your pooch calm, cool, and under control.

This is a class for dogs who already know the basics, but need some help 
around real-world distractions.

Since this is an outdoor class, FIDO offers Advanced Field Trip during the 
Spring and Summer months.

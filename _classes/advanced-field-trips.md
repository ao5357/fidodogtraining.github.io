Our Advanced Field Trip class takes you and your dog out and about to work 
on leash manners, reactivity, and recall. 

We practice self-control and focus in everyday situations, and teach you to 
keep your pooch calm, cool, and under control.

This is a class for dogs who have completed our Intermediate class or an equivalent class elsewhere.

Since this is an outdoor class, FIDO offers Advanced Field Trip during the 
Spring, Summer, and Fall months only.

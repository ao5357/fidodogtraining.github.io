Your puppy is growing by leaps and bounds — and so is his brain! You’ll learn about the needs of your now “teenage” puppy as well as how this stage of growth and development plays into different behavioral issues. We will continue working on and strengthening the basic cues learned in Puppy 1 as well as adding new cues such as ‘on your spot,’ ‘watch’ and ‘leave it.’ We’ll also still have plenty of playtime to keep your pup’s socialization skills sharp!

This class is only for graduates of our Puppy 1 class, and will prepare your dog for Basic 2

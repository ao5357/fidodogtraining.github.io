Your puppy is growing by leaps and bounds — and so is his brain! You’ll learn about 
the needs of your now “teenage” puppy as well as how this stage of growth and 
development plays into different behavioral issues. We will continue working on 
and strengthening the basic cues learned in Puppy 1 as well as adding new cues 
such as ‘on your spot,’ ‘watch’ and ‘leave it.’ We’ll also still have plenty of 
playtime to keep your pup’s socialization skills sharp!

This class is only for graduates of our Puppy 1 class, and will prepare your dog for Basic 2

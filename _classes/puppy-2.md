## Enhance your puppy's education with our Puppy 2 class

We continue our off-leash work with new cues such as 'watch' and 'leave it', 
practice what we learned in Puppy 1, and have plenty of playtime to keep your 
pup's socialization skills sharp.

This class is only for graduates of our Puppy 1 class, and will prepare your dog 
for Basic 2.

## Positive Reinforcement Training

This basic obedience class is for the older pups that need to learn the basics:

  * Sit
  * Down
  * Stay
  * Come

We will work on solving basic behavior problems, such as jumping and mouthing. 
If this sounds like your dog, let us help. Please join us for a basic six-week 
class in Positive Reinforcement/Clicker training.

*Please, do not bring your dog to the first class session*

## What is Positive Reinforcement Training?

It is learning something very pleasant or rewarding will happen immediately 
after a behavior. Pat Miller writes in her book, _The Power of Positive Reinforcement 
Training_:

 > All living things repeat behaviors that are rewarding and avoid behaviors that are not.

Positive Reinforcement Training works by reinforcing good behaviors that your 
dog already knows, like sitting and lying down. By rewarding these behaviors, 
dogs will want to offer them more.

How do you make your dog's unwanted behaviors go away? By rewarding behaviors 
you want and ignoring and/or preventing the ones you don't.

It is that simple. We'll teach you how to train your dog in a fun, rewarding way 
for both you and your dog.

_Your dog will love you for it_

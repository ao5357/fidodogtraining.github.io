## Positive Reinforcement Training

This class is for dogs five months and older (younger dogs are eligible for Puppy Class) that need to learn the basics! 

We will learn the obedience mainstays like Sit, Down, and Come as well as working on leash manners, polite greetings and  focus.


Basic One is a 6 week Clicker Course.

*Please, do not bring your dog to the first class session*

## What is Positive Reinforcement Training?

It is learning something very pleasant or rewarding will happen immediately 
after a behavior. Pat Miller writes in her book, _The Power of Positive Reinforcement 
Training_:

 > All living things repeat behaviors that are rewarding and avoid behaviors that are not.

Positive Reinforcement Training works by reinforcing good behaviors that your 
dog already knows, like sitting and lying down. By rewarding these behaviors, 
dogs will want to offer them more.

How do you make your dog's unwanted behaviors go away? By rewarding behaviors 
you want and ignoring and/or preventing the ones you don't.

It is that simple. We'll teach you how to train your dog in a fun, rewarding way 
for both you and your dog.

_Your dog will love you for it_

Emotional support animals, therapy dogs, facility dogs, service dogs, guide dogs, peacocks on airplanes!? 
What does all this mean? Explore the current state of laws, regulations, and ethical challenges in these 
new areas of canine helpers. Learn about what a service dog is and isn’t, what level of training is expected
for each type of dog, and what kinds of dogs fit well into these new roles. If you’re interested in having 
a dog with a job, this seminar is a great place to start by learning about what all of these terms mean and 
how they apply to the real world. This is a human-only seminar and we welcome people of all experience levels.

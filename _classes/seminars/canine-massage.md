Just like humans, dogs benefit greatly from massage. Fido’s canine massage workshop is a general introduction for 
the everyday dog parent on how to consciously and effectively massage their dog.  

During this workshop participants will cover the benefits of canine massage, review the muscular makeup of 
dogs, learn simple stretches and the proper techniques to provide a 10 minute daily “maintenance” massage for their 
dog.  Along with the new superpower of providing eye rolling, tongue lolling relaxation for your pup, every parent
will leave with a special blend of essential oils made specifically for dogs that can be incorporated into your new 
massage sessions. 

Our canine massage seminar is taught by Holly Schultz, a Certified Massage Therapist who has been working with both 
humans and canines for 13 years. Holly will demonstrate soothing touch techniques on our live demo dogs and every 
participant will get the chance to practice with her guidance.

If your dog barks, lunges, and growls when he spots another dog on walks, don't despair! We can help you with this
very common problem! 

Join us for a conversation on what leash reactivity is and where it stems from, how our response to it can amp things
up, and how to (finally!) have a nice walk with your dog. 

This is a limited space seminar, we only have room for 25 people (no dogs at this one, folks). If you are interested please call and let us know
you're coming.

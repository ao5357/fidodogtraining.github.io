Newly crawling and newly walking babies often make dogs anxious. We can help you connect the dots between
your child’s developmental milestones and dog behavior to promote safe interactions.

This seminar is for parents, grandparents, childcare professionals and others interested in supporting 
successful and safer dog and toddler interactions. You’ll learn how to help your dog adjust as your child’s 
motor skills develop. We’ll review management and training strategies to decrease stress and increase safety 
for all and identify fun ways to keep your dog safely included in daily activities. Please note that this is a 
humans-only seminar.

Does your dog know how to sit or lay down and stay with distraction?

Will he come when called every time?

Would you prefer to take your dog for a walk instead of a pull down the street?

How about teaching your pup a few fun tricks?

Is your pooch ready for the next level?

## The Three Ds

We add the three Ds -- Distance, Distraction, and Duration -- to our basic cues, and introduce more challenging exercises such as loose leash walking.

This class is for dogs that have completed Puppy or Basic 1, or have a good grasp of simple cues.

If this sounds like fun, please join us for this six-week obedience class in Positive Reinforcement/Clicker training.

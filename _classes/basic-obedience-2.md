Challenge your dog and take training further! Dogs that have completed our Basic One class or can demonstrate a strong basic skill set are welcome to join us for this fast-moving class where we add distance, distraction, and duration to our cues. 

Longer Stays, focus during distraction, and a lightning-fast Recall are all part of our six-week class where we really dig into the details of “talking dog”.
